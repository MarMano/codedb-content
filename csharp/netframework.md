### .Net Framework
The .Net Framework, is a framework developed by Microsoft, and gives the developer a large class 
library and ability to choose between multiple languages, including C#, C++, F# and VB.Net.  
When compiled the languages is compiled to a platform-neutral language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL). 
This language is then executed by the platform-specific Common Language Runtime (CLR), who runs the application on the system.

Historically has the .Net Platform only been on Windows, but initiatives such as [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) and [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) is spreading the framework to multiple platforms.
